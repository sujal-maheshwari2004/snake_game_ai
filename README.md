# snake_game_ai
This project features an AI-driven Snake game where the agent learns to play using Deep Q-Learning (DQN). Built with `Pygame`, the AI controls the snake, aiming to eat food while avoiding collisions with walls and its own body. Users can train the AI, visualize performance, and watch the agent improve through reinforcement learning.
